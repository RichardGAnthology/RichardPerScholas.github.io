        <p>Last year my brother went out and got a dog. It was a Shiba Inu and  
        her name is Yuki. In case anyone is wondering, the name is Japanese. 
        In Japanese, the name Yuki can mean snow, happiness, or luck - depending on how it's written or said. 
        My brother means for it to mean happiness.
        I don't have an image of my dog online, so instead, 
        I've picked a picture of a dog that closely resembles her... 
        and yes, I believe my dog best represents me.</p><br>

    <h4>Now, a little more about myself.</h4>
    <ol>
        <li class="space"> I find astronomy interesting because of just how 
            impossibly big the universe is.</li>
        <li>I enjoy listening to piano music. My favorite Pianists are Yann 
            Tiersen and Ludovico Einaudi.</li>
        <li class="space"> I hope to one day change how the world operates.</li>
        <li>I don't have just one favorite movie, I'm one of those annoying people
            that has three equally favorite movies - and those movies are 
            Interstellar, Am√©lie, and Contact.</li>
        <li class="space"> I don't like to watch the last episode of shows that I enjoy
            because I prefer the idea that I will always be able to finish my favorite
            shows.</li>
        <li> Some of my favorite shows are Doctor Who, Game of Thrones, and... hmm, 
            I'm sure there's a third one somewhere... And no, I haven't finished them.</li>
    </ol> <br>

    <p2>Below, you will find a video to a piano piece that is sure to move you... even if it's just your hand that moves to stop the video.</p2>
